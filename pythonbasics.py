# Python Basics

# Variables
# - cannot have spaces or symbols other than an underscore (_)
# - cannot begin with numbers, but can have numbers after the first letter (e.g. var_1)
breakfast = "steak and eggs"

# Strings
print("This is a string.")

# Numbers
# Integers
integer_example = 12
# Floats
float_example = 8.7

# Errors
# - Python will point to error location with a ^ character
# - 1. SyntaxError: something is wrong with the way it is written (wrong punctuation, wrong command, missing parenthesis)
# - 2. NameError: code contains something that is a variable but was never defined
